Please write commit messages that describe your work, don't forget to comment your source code as well.

## Bulding the program

**NOTE: You need g++ installed on your system, if it's _Windows_ use MinGW, else if it's _Linux_ download g++ using your package manager.**

1. Change your folder to 'src' folder and type following commands:

```
$ gcc -std=c++11 main.cpp methods.cpp -o main
   ./main
```

## Commiting and Pushing changes

1. Create a new branch named 'new' with a command:

```
$ git checkout -b new
```

2. Always change your branch before working on a repository with a command:

```
$ git checkout new
```

3. After you've changed your branch, edit files, add new features and then commit your work.

**NOTE: WRITE DESCRIPTIVE COMMITS**

For making a commit use command:

```
$ git commit -m "description of commit"
```

4. At the end push your changes to new branch(_not master_) with command:

```
$ git push origin new
```
